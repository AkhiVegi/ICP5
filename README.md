# ICP5 is about to implement following
1. Implement Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library Use dataset available with name glass
Use train_test_split to create training and testing part Evaluate the model on test part using score and
classification_report(y_true, y_pred)
2. Implement linear SVM method using scikit library Use the same dataset above
Use train_test_split to create training and testing part Evaluate the model on test part using score and
classification_report(y_true, y_pred)
Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?
